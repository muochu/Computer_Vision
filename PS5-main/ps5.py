        These steps will calculate the weighted mean. The resulting values

          plotted by drawing a colored dot point on the image. Remember that

          Bayesian estimate for the current location which is simply the
          weighted mean of the (x, y) of the particles.
        - Finally we need to get some sense of the standard deviation or
          spread of the distribution. First, find the distance of every
          particle to the weighted mean. Next, take the weighted sum of these
